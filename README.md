# Eugene Sculpture Group

> A Client Vue.js project for an artist collective in Eugene, Oregon

I developed this site to replace a super slow WP site.  
The site is hosted on a basic shared server - so the WP site was not performant at all.  
I redesigned the site from scratch, implementing hooper.js for the homepage silder.  
I rolled my own repsonsive image grid for each of the artists, using some images that they had provided.  
I also rolled my own modal slideshow.  
Some of the images I shot myself.  
From there, I used Adbobe Lightroom to spice all the images up a bit.
